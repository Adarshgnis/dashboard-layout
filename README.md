#  ReactJS Dashboard

I have developed a dynamic dashboard website using ReactJS that offers an intuitive user experience. Here's an overview of the key features and functionalities:

`User Registration and Login:` 
-Upon visiting the website, users encounter a login form.
-For first-time visitors, a user-friendly signup option is available.
-Users can fill out the signup form, and upon clicking the signup button, their data is securely stored in local storage.
-Once registered, they are automatically directed to the dashboard page.
