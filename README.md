#  ReactJS Dashboard

I have developed a dynamic dashboard website using ReactJS that offers an intuitive user experience. Here's an overview of the key features and functionalities:

`User Registration and Login:` 
- Upon visiting the website, users encounter a login form.
- For first-time visitors, a user-friendly signup option is available.
- Users can fill out the signup form, and upon clicking the signup button, their data is securely stored in local storage.
- Once registered, they are automatically directed to the dashboard page.

  `Dashboard Page:`
- The dashboard provides a personalized experience by displaying the user's username, which was entered during signup.
- All the data displayed on this page is retrieved from a JSON file, which ensures flexibility and easy maintenance.
- Reusable components are implemented, minimizing redundant code and promoting code efficiency.

  `Navigation and Single Page Application (SPA):`
- The website's navigation is seamlessly handled using the React Router library, creating a smooth SPA experience.
- Users can easily transition between the main dashboard and profile pages.

  `Logout Functionality:`
- A logout button is incorporated, allowing users to log out and securely exit their session.
- Users can quickly re-login by entering the same username they used during signup.
